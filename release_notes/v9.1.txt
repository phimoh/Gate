This version is intended to be used with Geant4 10.7 only. 


-----------------
Main new features
-----------------

- new Benchmarks system 
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/GateBenchmarks

- Decay now works with all Physics Lists
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/421

- SimulationStatisticActor: add options to get track types
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/420

- range actor (in particular for e+)
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/400

- add options to Phase Space
  enableTrackLength and enableTimeFromBeginOfEvent
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/409

- CCMod (Compton Camera module) improvements
  electron escape info and coincidence sorter policies
  and documentation updates
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/408

- improvements in LET and EnergySpectrum-Actor
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/405

- 3 additional Physics Lists: 
  Single scattering = emstandard_SS
  Goudsmit Saunderson = emstandard_GS
  Low-energy = emLowEP
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/370

- default energy for ion is now 0 MeV and not 1.0 MeV (like in Geant4), which was confusing
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/366

- Score energy deposition exploiting polar/cylindrical symmetry
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/331

- Mask options in phase space (use a binary image)
  (was already there in the 9.0 but not advertised in the log)
  https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/commit/28be98c2db95e47e5486de28f86fb890d0117f76
